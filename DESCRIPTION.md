As promised and agreed, please see the code challenge. I am sending it
now to give you a chance to investigate Google App Engine. I would like
the code delivered to me as a Github repo that I can access, with a clear
README file with install instructions. I will also need the code up and
running on a cloud platform.

Please complete it before the end of tomorrow. Just send me an email when
you are done, letting me know how many hours you took.

Octopus is keen to develop its technology as a series of cloud based,
RESTful micro-services, with good security measures in place to protect
customer data. The code-challenge thus includes the requirement to build
some application-level encryption.

1) Create a Python web application using Tornado web server and host it
as an App Engine project on Google.

2) The project should have a single page with a form where I can enter a
URL to any website (e.g. Wikipedia or BBCNews)

3) The application should fetch that url and build a dictionary that
contains the frequency of use of each word on that page.

4) Use this dictionary to display, on the client’s browser, a “word
cloud” of the top 100 words, where the font size is largest for the words
used most frequently, and gets progressively smaller for words used less
often.

5) Each time a URL is fetched, it should save the top 100 words to a
MySQL DB (Google Cloud SQL), with the following three columns:

a) The primary key for the word is a salted hash of the word.

b) The word itself is saved in a column that has asymmetrical encryption,
and you are saving the encrypted version of the word.

c) The total frequency count of the word.

Each time a new URL is fetched, you should INSERT or UPDATE the word
rows.

6) An “admin” page, that will list all words entered into the DB, ordered
by frequency of usage, visible in decrypted form.

Extra points for:

- Displaying just nouns and verbs (no prepositions or articles)

- In README, describe the best way to safely store and manage the keys.

- Elegant front end layout.

- Clean, well documented code.

Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.

Good luck!
